# parliwho_public

My public repository for all data I collect on UK Parliament.

For MPs
Programme for scraping data on all UK MPs from parliament.uk. Data includes name, constituency, party, intake year, Gov post, opposition post, and Select Committees.

This data was used to create the database for parliwho.com.

The results of the programme as executed on 3rd May 2020 is available in all_mps.py.

For Peers
peers_list.py and peers_interests.php both accurate as of 8th May 2020. Running scrape.py will update both.

Feel free to use anythin ghere, but all credit to williamfro.st please.
