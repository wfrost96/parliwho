# parliwho

Multiple programmes for making use of publically available data around UK Parliament, Peers, and MPs.

<h2>For MPs</h2>
Program for scraping data on all UK MPs from parliament.uk. Data includes name, gender, constituency, party, intake year, Gov/opposition post and department, and Select Committees.
<br><br>
This data was used to create the database for parliwho.com.
<br><br>
The results of the program as executed on 25th September 2020 are available in all_mps.py. Running scrape.py will of course update it.

<h2>For Peers</h2>
peers_list.py and peers_interests.php both accurate as of 8th May 2020. Running scrape.py will update both.
