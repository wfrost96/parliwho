# parliwho_public

My public repository for all data I collect on UK Parliament.

<h2>For MPs</h2>
Programme for scraping data on all UK MPs from parliament.uk. Data includes name, constituency, party, intake year, Gov post, opposition post, and Select Committees.
<br><br>
This data was used to create the database for parliwho.com.
<br><br>
The results of the programme as executed on 3rd May 2020 is available in all_mps.py.

<h2>For Peers</h2>
peers_list.py and peers_interests.php both accurate as of 8th May 2020. Running scrape.py will update both.
